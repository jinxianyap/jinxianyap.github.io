## Software Engineer

Hi, Iâ€™m a final-year Computing student at Imperial College London.
I started out in the world of software engineering through web development using frameworks such as React and Angular. I have since delved into building software and studying topics like algorithms and distributed systems. I am also interested in machine learning and data science, specifically in its application in diverse industries and use cases.

On another note, I enjoy baking and playing golf in my free time. I listen to tech podcasts regularly, and I am on an ongoing quest to find the perfect flat white.
